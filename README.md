# Hello-world-
My first repository on git hub 
So I am pretty new to all of this and would really like to learn more and become an active member in this community and ultimately learn more and more about writing code. I am a College sstudent who has realizes how much use this skill set will allow an individual in the world today and would very much like to be apart of it. Though my major is quite far from this field I am a firm believer in the idea that "no skill is a waste", so with all this being said i will continue my progression into this field. Thank You.
